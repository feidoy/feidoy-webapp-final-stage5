              A computer is a machine that can execute a program. With the right program, a computer can do any mechanical computation you can imagine.
              A program describes a very precise sequence of steps. Since the computer is just a machine, the program must give the steps in a way that can be executed mechanically. That is, the program can be followed without any thought.
              A programming language is a language designed for producing computer programs. A good programming language makes it easy for humans to read and write programs that can be executed by a computer.

              Python is a programming language. The programs that we write in the Python language will be the input to the Python interpreter, which is a program that runs on the computer. The Python interpreter reads our programs and executes them by following the rules of the Python language.

          Grammar:

            <p>
              Compared to a natural language, programming languages adhere to a strict grammatical structure. In English, even if a phrase is written or spoken incorrectly, it can still be understood with the help of context or other cues. On the other hand, in a programming language like Python, the code must match the language grammar exactly. The Python interpreter has no idea what to do with input that is not in the Python language, so it produces an error.
            </p>
            <p>
              When programming language grammar is not followed the interpreter will return a SyntaxError message. This means that the structure of the code is inconsistent with the rules of the programming language.

            <p>
              Variables make programs easy to understand.  They can also use the same expression changing values of variables to compute different things. To assign variables, you'll need to create a 'name' and assign its 'value or expression' after placing an equal sign. (e.g. name = expression).  Basically in a program you want to assign a name and its value. When you "print" a variables name, it will generate its value.

              Variables can vary.  = signs means assignment.ar:

              For comments, use hashtag #.  The python interpreter will ignore this line.  Commenting is used to help leave notes on code, which will help you in the future to remember how things were laid out, or even help others understand your code.

            Expressions are one of the most basic instructions for a computer. The expression is made up of values and operators that evaluate down to single values.  A single value can also be called an expression.
